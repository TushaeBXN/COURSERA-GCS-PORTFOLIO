## Key Observations
1. **Repeated DNS Requests**:
   - The IP `192.51.100.15` repeatedly attempted to query `203.0.113.2` for the domain `yummyrecipesforme.com` (A record query).
   - Timestamps indicate retries approximately every 2 minutes.

2. **ICMP Responses**:
   - The DNS server (`203.0.113.2`) responded with ICMP messages indicating **UDP port 53 is unreachable**.
   - The issue persists across multiple requests, suggesting a recurring problem.

## Potential Causes
1. **DNS Server Unavailability**:
   - The DNS server may be offline or experiencing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
2. **Firewall Blocking**:
   - Firewall rules may be blocking UDP traffic to port 53.
3. **Misconfiguration**:
   - DNS server misconfiguration could prevent proper handling of incoming requests.

## Next Steps
1. **DNS Server Investigation**:
   - Verify if the server at `203.0.113.2` is operational.
   - Check for signs of DoS attacks or resource exhaustion.

2. **Firewall Configuration**:
   - Review and update firewall rules to ensure proper handling of DNS traffic.

3. **Log Monitoring**:
   - Continue monitoring traffic logs for patterns or anomalies.
   - Use tools like `tcpdump` or `Wireshark` for deeper packet analysis.

4. **DNS Configuration Review**:
   - Validate DNS server settings and ensure proper query handling.
