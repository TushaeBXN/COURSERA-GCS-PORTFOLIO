# Cybersecurity Incident Report: SYN Flood

---

## Section 1: Identifying the Type of Attack and Explaining the Network Disruption

### **Type of Attack**
The network interruption was identified as a **Denial of Service (DoS) SYN Flood attack** based on automated alerts and detailed analysis.

### **Network Disruption Details**
- Initial alert: An automated notification flagged an issue with the web server, leading to connection timeouts for website visitors.
- Investigation: 
  - **Tool used**: Wireshark for TCP/HTTP log analysis.
  - **Findings**: A surge in TCP SYN requests from an unfamiliar IP address was detected, confirming a potential SYN Flood attack.

## Section 2: How the Attack Causes Website Malfunction

### **Attack Mechanism: Exploiting the TCP Handshake**
In a SYN flood attack, the malicious actor manipulates the TCP handshake process by overwhelming the server with excessive connection requests. Here's how the handshake normally works:
1. **SYN (Synchronize)**: The initiating device sends a SYN packet to the destination device, signaling a connection request.
2. **SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge)**: The destination device responds with a SYN-ACK packet, acknowledging the request and indicating readiness to connect.
3. **ACK (Acknowledge)**: The initiating device sends an ACK packet, completing the connection setup, after which data exchange begins.

### **Impact of the SYN Flood**
- The server's limited port availability becomes overwhelmed, preventing legitimate connections.
- Results include:
  - Website slowdown or total inaccessibility.
  - Revenue loss and diminished customer trust.
  - Potential damage to server infrastructure and stored data.

## Recommendations for Mitigation

To prevent future SYN Flood attacks, implement the following proactive measures:

1. **Next Generation Firewall (NGFW)**:
   - Monitor and analyze traffic patterns for signs of suspicious activity.
   - Block malicious SYN requests in real-time.

2. **VPNs and Encryption**:
   - Conceal the web server's IP address, making it harder for attackers to target.

3. **Network Subnetting**:
   - Isolate critical resources within subnets to contain the impact of attacks and prevent widespread disruptions.
