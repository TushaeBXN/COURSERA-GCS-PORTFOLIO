# File Permissions in Linux

## Project Description
The research team at my organization needed to update file permissions for files and directories within the `projects` directory. Current permissions did not reflect the level of authorization needed, so I checked and updated them to ensure system security.

---

## Tasks Performed

### 1. Check File and Directory Details
I used Linux commands to determine existing permissions for a specific directory in the file system.

```bash
# Command to list files and their permissions
ls -la /home/researcher2/projects
This command displayed a detailed listing of all files, including hidden files in the projects directory. 
The permissions were represented by a 10-character string in the first column.

## 2. Describe the Permissions String
Permissions string explained:

1st Character: Indicates file type (d for directory, - for regular file).
2nd-4th Characters: Read (r), Write (w), Execute (x) for the user.
5th-7th Characters: Read (r), Write (w), Execute (x) for the group.
8th-10th Characters: Read (r), Write (w), Execute (x) for other users.

Example:
For project_t.txt, the permissions are:-rw-rw-r--

File: - (regular file)
User: rw (read and write)
Group: rw (read and write)
Other: r (read-only)

## 3. Change File Permissions
a) Remove Write Access for Others
The organization wanted to restrict write access for others. For project_k.txt:
# Remove write access for others
chmod o-w /home/researcher2/projects/project_k.txt

# Verify changes
ls -la /home/researcher2/projects

## 3b b) Update Permissions on a Hidden File
The file .project_x.txt was archived, requiring only read access for the user and group, and no write access.
# Update permissions on a hidden file
chmod u-w,g-w,g+r /home/researcher2/projects/.project_x.txt

# Verify changes
ls -la /home/researcher2/projects

## 4. Change Directory Permissions
The drafts directory should only allow researcher2 to have execute permissions. No other users should have access.
# Remove execute permissions for the group
chmod g-x /home/researcher2/projects/drafts

# Verify changes
ls -la /home/researcher2/projects

## Summary
The following steps were performed:

Checked file and directory permissions using ls -la.
Updated permissions with the chmod command:
Removed write access for others on specific files.
Adjusted permissions for hidden files.
Modified directory permissions to restrict access.
These updates enhanced the system's security by ensuring that access levels matched the organization's requirements.
