# Apply Filters to SQL Queries

## Project Description
My organization is working to enhance system security. 
My role involves ensuring the system is safe, investigating potential security issues, and updating employee computers as needed. 
This project demonstrates how I used SQL filters to perform security-related tasks.

## Retrieve After-Hours Failed Login Attempts
There was a potential security incident that occurred after business hours (after 18:00). All failed login attempts during these hours needed to be investigated.

### SQL Query
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_time > '18:00' AND success = FALSE;

SQL Example Output
event_id	username	login_date	login_time	country	ip_address	    success
2	        patel	    2022-05-10	20:27:27	  CAN	    192.168.205.12	FALSE
18	      pwashing	2022-05-11	19:28:50	  US	    192.168.66.142	FALSE
20	      tshah	    2022-05-12	18:56:36	  MEXICO	192.168.109.50	FALSE

SQL Query
SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_date BETWEEN '2022-05-08' AND '2022-05-09';

Explanation
login_date BETWEEN '2022-05-08' AND '2022-05-09': Filters for login attempts on 2022-05-09 and the preceding day.
