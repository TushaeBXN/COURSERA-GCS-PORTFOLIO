# Vulnerability Assessment Report

**Date:** 16th November 2023

---

## System Description
The server hardware consists of:
- A powerful CPU processor with **128GB of memory**.
- The latest version of the **Linux operating system**.
- A **MySQL database management system**.
- A stable **network connection using IPv4 addresses**.
- **SSL/TLS encrypted connections** for security.

This server interacts with other servers on the network, serving as a critical component for storing and managing data securely.

---

## Scope
- **Focus:** The current access controls of the system.
- **Assessment Period:** June 20XX to August 20XX (three months).
- **Guidance:** Risk analysis is conducted using **NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1**.

---

## Purpose
The database server:
- Acts as a central system to store and manage large volumes of data.
- Hosts **customer information**, **campaign details**, and **analytical data**.
- Supports **marketing operations** by enabling performance tracking and personalized marketing.

Securing this system is critical to maintaining operational continuity and protecting sensitive information.

## Risk Assessment

| **Threat Source**      | **Threat Event**                                   | **Likelihood** | **Severity** | **Risk** |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| **Hacker (Outside)**    | Exploiting the open database to gain unauthorized access. | 3              | 3            | 9        |
| **Employee (Insider)**  | Deliberate disruption of mission-critical operations.      | 2              | 3            | 6        |
| **Competitor**          | Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack using technical capabilities. | 2              | 3            | 6        |

## Approach
This vulnerability assessment evaluates potential risks to the **e-commerce platform**:

1. **External Threats (Hacker):**
   - Highlights risks from the **public accessibility** of the database.
   - Emphasizes robust measures to protect sensitive information.

2. **Internal Threats (Employee):**
   - Acknowledges risks of **deliberate disruptions**.
   - Underscores the need for **internal security protocols**.

3. **Competitor Threats:**
   - Recognizes risks of **denial-of-service attacks** to business continuity.
   - Stresses the importance of **proactive safeguards** against disruptions.

This holistic approach ensures both **internal** and **external vulnerabilities** are addressed, maintaining system integrity.

## Remediation Strategy
To address identified risks:
- **For Unauthorized Access (Hacker):**
  - Enforce the **principle of least privilege** to limit access rights.
  - Implement a **defense-in-depth strategy** with layered security measures.

- **For Insider Threats (Employee):**
  - Use **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** to enhance access security.
  - Adopt a robust **Authentication, Authorization, Accounting (AAA) framework** to control user access.

- **For Competitor Threats:**
  - Strengthen protocols to mitigate **denial-of-service attacks**.
  - Enhance monitoring and incident response strategies.

These measures collectively strengthen the security posture of the e-commerce platform, mitigating both internal and external threats.
