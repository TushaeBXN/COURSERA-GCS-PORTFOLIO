# Applying the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** outlines five core functions: **Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover** to manage cybersecurity risks effectively.

## Core Functions

### 1. Identify
Audit systems, processes, and people to uncover vulnerabilities.
- **Assets:** Which devices, software, and networks are affected?
- **Processes:** Which business workflows are impacted?
- **People:** Who needs access to affected systems?

---

### 2. Protect
Safeguard critical assets with preventative measures.
- **Access Control:** Limit access to necessary personnel.
- **Awareness/Training:** Educate staff on prevention strategies.
- **Data Security:** Enhance protection for sensitive data.
- **Technologies:** Update firewalls, IPS, and software as needed.

---

### 3. Detect
Identify threats with monitoring and detection tools.
- **Anomalies:** Use tools like SIEM for threat alerts.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Implement network monitoring processes.
- **Processes:** Leverage IDS to detect suspicious activities.

---

### 4. Respond
Mitigate and manage incidents effectively.
- **Planning:** Establish action plans for future incidents.
- **Communication:** Inform stakeholders, staff, and end users.
- **Mitigation:** Isolate and contain affected resources.
- **Improvements:** Refine response strategies.

---

### 5. Recover
Restore systems and processes after incidents.
- **Planning:** Define recovery processes for resources and data.
- **Improvements:** Update recovery systems and procedures.
- **Communication:** Keep stakeholders informed during restoration.

## Summary
The NIST CSF provides a comprehensive framework to identify, mitigate, and recover from cybersecurity threats. 
These functions help organizations stay resilient, minimize risks, and adapt to evolving threats.
