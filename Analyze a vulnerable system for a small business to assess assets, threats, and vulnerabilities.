## Threat Sources
Threat sources are entities or circumstances that may negatively impact an organization's information systems. These sources can be internal or external.

### Types of Threat Sources
| **Type**             | **Examples**              | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Standard User**     | Employee, Customer       | May accidentally or purposefully exploit resources, altering or stealing data. |
| **Privileged User**   | System Admin             | Has elevated access, posing greater risk to systems and data.                  |
| **Group**             | Competitor, Nation State | Intentional exploitation for gain or disruption.                               |
| **Outsider**          | Hacker, APT              | Exploit vulnerabilities through unauthorized access or malware.                |

## Threat Events
Threat events are actual instances where a threat source exploits a vulnerability, causing harm to systems.

### Examples of Threat Events
| **Event**                                            | **Description**                                                                   |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Perform reconnaissance                               | Assess vulnerabilities using tools or observations.                              |
| Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration       | Install malware to locate and extract sensitive data.                            |
| Alter/Delete critical information                   | Modify or remove data essential to operations.                                   |
| Craft counterfeit certificates                      | Compromise certificate authorities for illegitimate connections.                 |
| Conduct Denial of Service (DoS) attacks             | Overwhelm system capabilities with excessive requests.                           |
| Install persistent network sniffers                 | Capture network traffic to collect sensitive information.                        |
| Disrupt mission-critical operations                 | Prevent critical business functions through data tampering.                      |
| Conduct "man-in-the-middle" attacks                 | Intercept and relay communication to compromise system trust.                    |

## Likelihood of a Threat Event
The likelihood of a threat event is assessed based on evidence, prior experience, and expert judgment. This is expressed through a combination of qualitative and quantitative values.

### Likelihood Values
| **Qualitative** | **Quantitative** | **Description**                                                               |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| High            | 3                | Almost certain to occur; severe impact.                                      |
| Moderate        | 2                | Somewhat likely; significant functional reduction.                           |
| Low             | 1                | Highly unlikely; minimal or negligible effects.                              |

## Severity of a Threat Event
Severity measures the potential impact of a threat event on business operations, ranging from minor disruptions to complete operational failures.

### Severity Values
| **Qualitative** | **Quantitative** | **Description**                                                               |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| High            | 3                | Multiple, severe, or catastrophic effects on operations and assets.          |
| Moderate        | 2                | Significant reduction in operational functionality.                           |
| Low             | 1                | Minor or negligible effects.                                                 |
