# Security Hardening Tasks

## Description and Common Uses

### Baseline Configurations
- **Description:** A documented set of specifications used as a basis for system builds, releases, and updates.
- **Uses:** Restore systems after network outages or unauthorized changes.

### Configuration Checks
- **Description:** Update encryption standards for stored data.
- **Uses:** Detect unauthorized system changes.

### Disabling Unused Ports
- **Description:** Block unused ports on firewalls, routers, and servers to prevent malicious traffic.
- **Uses:** Prevent attacks before incidents occur or block future attacks.

### Encryption Using Latest Standards
- **Description:** Use updated rules for encrypting outgoing and decrypting incoming data.
- **Uses:** Regularly assess encryption security or update encryption after breaches.

### Firewall Maintenance
- **Description:** Regularly check and update firewall security configurations.
- **Uses:** Protect against abnormal traffic and DDoS attacks.

### Hardware & Software Disposal
- **Description:** Properly wipe and dispose of outdated hardware and software.
- **Uses:** Prevent threats from unpatched devices.

### Multifactor Authentication (MFA)
- **Description:** Verify user identity with two or more methods (e.g., password, fingerprint, OTP).
- **Uses:** Defend against brute force attacks and enhance overall access security.

### Network Access Privileges
- **Description:** Control access to network assets for roles, groups, IPs, and MAC addresses.
- **Uses:** Reduce risks of unauthorized access and mitigate social engineering threats.

### Network Log Analysis
- **Description:** Examine network logs for suspicious activity.
- **Uses:** Alert security teams to abnormal traffic; track traffic during and after incidents using SIEM tools.

### Password Policies
- **Description:** Follow NIST guidelines to use salting and hashing instead of frequent password changes.
- **Uses:** Defend against brute force attacks and prevent password guessing.

### Patch Updates
- **Description:** Apply software and OS updates to address vulnerabilities.
- **Uses:** Fix security problems and prevent exploits from known vulnerabilities.

### Penetration Testing (Pen Test)
- **Description:** Simulated attacks to identify system vulnerabilities.
- **Uses:** Proactively prevent potential attacks.

### Port Filtering
- **Description:** Use firewalls to block or allow specific port numbers.
- **Uses:** Control network traffic and block unauthorized access.

### Removing or Disabling Unused Applications and Services
- **Description:** Eliminate unused applications and services that may not be updated.
- **Uses:** Reduce vulnerabilities within the network.

### Server and Data Storage Backups
- **Description:** Protect data assets with physical or cloud backups.
- **Uses:** Restore lost data from attacks, errors, or equipment failures.
