# Security Risk Assessment Report

---

## Part 1: Selected Hardening Tools and Methods
1. **Password Policies**
2. **Firewall Maintenance**
3. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

---

## Part 2: Recommendations

### 1. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **Why?**  
  - MFA significantly increases security by requiring multiple forms of verification, making it harder for attackers to breach the network.
  - It also prevents internal users from sharing passwords, which is especially critical for users with admin access.

---

### 2. Password Policies
- **Why?**  
  - Following strong password policies enhances user security and reduces the likelihood of breaches.
  - Regular enforcement and adherence to password rules are essential to mitigate risks.

---

### 3. Firewall Maintenance
- **Why?**  
  - Regular maintenance and updates to firewall rules help protect against suspicious network traffic and various types of attacks.
  - Firewalls should be updated promptly in response to any identified security issues.

## Summary
Implementing these three methods—**MFA**, **strong password policies**, and **firewall maintenance**—provides a robust defense against unauthorized access, strengthens internal security, and mitigates risks from external threats.
