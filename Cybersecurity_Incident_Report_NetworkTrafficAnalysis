# Cybersecurity Incident Report: Network Traffic Analysis

---

## Part 1: Summary of the Problem in DNS and ICMP Traffic Logs

- **Issue Identified**: The DNS server is unreachable.
- **Evidence**:
  - Network analysis results indicate an **ICMP echo reply** with the error message: `"UDP port 53 unreachable"`.
  - **Port 53** is typically used for DNS protocol traffic.
- **Likely Cause**: The DNS server is not responding.

## Part 2: Data Analysis and Possible Cause of the Incident

### **Timeline and Observations**
- **Incident Start Time**: November 3rd, 13:24 PM.
- **How It Was Detected**: Customers reported errors, specifically a `"destination port unreachable"` message when trying to access the website.
- **Verification**:
  - The IT team confirmed the issue via browser testing.
  - **Packet Sniffing**: Conducted using `tcpdump`, which revealed logs indicating that **DNS port 53 was unreachable**.

### **Potential Causes**
1. **DNS Server Issues**:
   - The server may be down due to:
     - A successful **Denial of Service (DoS) attack**.
     - Misconfigurations leading to unresponsiveness.
2. **Firewall Interference**:
   - Traffic to **port 53** might be blocked by firewall rules.

## Next Steps
1. **Verify DNS Server Status**:
   - Check for signs of DoS attack activity.
   - Confirm DNS server configurations and restart if necessary.
2. **Inspect Firewall Rules**:
   - Review and update firewall policies to ensure traffic to port 53 is not erroneously blocked.
3. **Mitigate and Monitor**:
   - Implement additional monitoring tools to detect similar issues in real-time.
   - Evaluate current defenses against DoS attacks and reinforce where necessary.

## Conclusion
This report highlights a potential DNS server unavailability, identified through ICMP and UDP protocol analysis. Immediate action to diagnose and resolve the server's state or firewall settings will mitigate further disruption.
